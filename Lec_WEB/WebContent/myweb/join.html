                            and obligations as a subscriber of Steam from Valve Corporation, a corporation under the
                            laws of the State of Washington, with its registered office at 10400 NE 4th St., Bellevue,
                            WA 98004, United States, registered with the Washington Secretary of State under number 60
                            22 90 773, VAT ID No. EU 8260 00671 ("Valve"). Please read it carefully.

                            SECTION 11 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS HOW
                            DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED. PLEASE READ IT. IF YOU LIVE IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA) OR THE
                            EUROPEAN UNION, SECTION 11 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                            <br>
                            1. REGISTRATION AS A SUBSCRIBER; APPLICATION OF TERMS TO YOU; YOUR ACCOUNT ⏶
                            <br>
                            Steam is an online service offered by Valve.
                            <br>
                            You become a subscriber of Steam ("Subscriber") by completing the registration of a Steam
                            user account. This Agreement takes effect as soon as you indicate your acceptance of these
                            terms. You may not become a subscriber if you are under the age of 13. Steam is not intended
                            for children under 13 and Valve will not knowingly collect personal information from
                            children under the age of 13.

                            A. Contracting Party

                            For any interaction with Steam your contractual relationship is with Valve. Except as
                            otherwise indicated at the time of the transaction (such as in the case of purchases from
                            another Subscriber in a Subscription Marketplace), any transactions for Subscriptions (as
                            defined below) you make on Steam are being made from Valve.

                            B. Subscriptions; Content and Services

                            As a Subscriber you may obtain access to certain services, software and content available to
                            Subscribers. The Steam client software and any other software, content, and updates you
                            download or access via Steam, including but not limited to Valve or third-party video games
                            and in-game content, software associated with Hardware and any virtual items you trade, sell
                            or purchase in a Steam Subscription Marketplace are referred to in this Agreement as
                            "Content and Services;" the rights to access and/or use any Content and Services accessible
                            through Steam are referred to in this Agreement as "Subscriptions."

                            Each Subscription allows you to access particular Content and Services. Some Subscriptions
                            may impose additional terms specific to that Subscription ("Subscription Terms") (for
                            example, an end user license agreement specific to a particular game, or terms of use
                            specific to a particular product or feature of Steam). Also, additional terms (for example,
                            payment and billing procedures) may be posted on http://www.steampowered.com or within the
                            Steam service ("Rules of Use"). Rules of Use include the Steam Online Conduct Rules
                            http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct and the Steam Refund Policy
                            http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. The Subscription Terms, the Rules of Use, and
                            the Valve Privacy Policy (which can be found at http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm)
                            are binding on you once you indicate your acceptance of them or of this Agreement, or
                            otherwise become bound by them as described in Section 8 (Amendments to this Agreement).

                            C. Your Account

                            When you complete Steam’s registration process, you create a Steam account ("Account"). Your
                            Account may also include billing information you provide to Valve for the purchase of
                            Subscriptions, Content and Services and any physical goods offered for purchase through
                            Steam (“Hardware”). You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password
                            or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve. You are responsible for the
                            confidentiality of your login and password and for the security of your computer system.
                            Valve is not responsible for the use of your password and Account or for all of the
                            communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your login name and password by
                            you, or by any person to whom you may have intentionally or by negligence disclosed your
                            login and/or password in violation of this confidentiality provision. Unless it results from
                            Valve’s negligence or fault, Valve is not responsible for the use of your Account by a
                            person who fraudulently used your login and password without your permission. If you believe
                            that the confidentiality of your login and/or password may have been compromised, you must
                            notify Valve via the support form (https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php) without
                            any delay.

                            Your Account, including any information pertaining to it (e.g.: contact information, billing
                            information, Account history and Subscriptions, etc.), is strictly personal. You may
                            therefore not sell or charge others for the right to use your Account, or otherwise transfer
                            your Account, nor may you sell, charge others for the right to use, or transfer any
                            Subscriptions other than if and as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including any
                            Subscription Terms or Rules of Use) or as otherwise specifically permitted by Valve.

                            D. Payment Processing

                            Payment processing related to Content and Services and/or Hardware purchased on Steam is
                            performed by either Valve Corporation directly or by Valve’s fully owned subsidiary Valve
                            GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation depending on the type of payment method used. If your
                            card was issued outside the United States, your payment may be processed via a European
                            acquirer by Valve GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation. For any other type of purchases,
                            payment will be collected by Valve Corporation directly. In any case, delivery of Content
                            and Services as well as Hardware is performed by Valve Corporation.

                            2. LICENSES ⏶

                            A. General Content and Services License

                            Steam and your Subscription(s) require the download and installation of Content and Services
                            onto your computer. Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right,
                            to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use (except where
                            commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable Subscription Terms). This
                            license ends upon termination of (a) this Agreement or (b) a Subscription that includes the
                            license. The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or
                            ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of the Content and Services, you must
                            have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining
                            a connection to the Internet.

                            For reasons that include, without limitation, system security, stability, and multiplayer
                            interoperability, Steam may need to automatically update, pre-load, create new versions of
                            or otherwise enhance the Content and Services and accordingly, the system requirements to
                            use the Content and Services may change over time. You consent to such automatic updating.
                            You understand that this Agreement (including applicable Subscription Terms) does not
                            entitle you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements of the Content and
                            Services associated with a particular Subscription, although Valve may choose to provide
                            such updates, etc. in its sole discretion.

                            B. Beta Software License

                            Valve may from time to time make software accessible to you via Steam prior to the general
                            commercial release of such software ("Beta Software"). You are not required to use Beta
                            Software, but if Valve offers it, you may elect to use it under the following terms. Beta
                            Software will be deemed to consist of Content and Services, and each item of Beta Software
                            provided will be deemed a Subscription for such Beta Software, with the following provisions
                            specific to Beta Software:

                            Your right to use the Beta Software may be limited in time, and may be subject to additional
                            Subscription Terms;
                            Valve or any Valve affiliate may request or require that you provide suggestions, feedback,
                            or data regarding your use of the Beta Software, which will be deemed User Generated Content
                            under Section 6 (User Generated Content) below; and
                            In addition to the waivers and limitations of liability for all Software under Section 7
                            (Disclaimers; Limitations on Liability; No Guarantees; Limited Warranty & Agreement) below
                            as applicable, you specifically acknowledge that Beta Software is only released for testing
                            and improvement purposes, in particular to provide Valve with feedback on the quality and
                            usability of the Beta Software, and therefore contains errors, is not final and may create
                            incompatibilities or damage to your computer, data, and/or software. If you decide to
                            install and/or use Beta Software, you shall only use it in compliance with its purposes,
                            i.e. for testing and improvement purposes and in any case not on a system or for purposes
                            where the malfunction of the Beta Software can cause any kind of damage. In particular,
                            maintain full backups of any system that you choose to install Beta Software on.
                            C. License to Use Valve Developer Tools

                            Your Subscription(s) may include access to various Valve tools that can be used to create
                            content ("Developer Tools"). Some examples include: the Valve software development kit (the
                            "SDK") for a version of the computer game engine known as "Source" (the "Source Engine") and
                            the associated Valve Hammer editor, The Source® Filmmaker Software, or in-game tools through
                            which you can edit or create derivative works of a Valve game. Particular Developer Tools
                            (for example, The Source® Filmmaker Software) may be distributed with separate Subscription
                            Terms that are different from the rules set forth in this Section. Except as set forth in
                            any separate Subscription Terms applicable to the use of a particular Developer Tool, you
                            may use the Developer Tools, and you may use, reproduce, publish, perform, display and
                            distribute any content you create using the Developer Tools, however you wish, but solely on
                            a non-commercial basis.

                            If you would like to use the Source Engine SDK or other Valve Developer Tools for commercial
                            use, please contact Valve at sourceengine@valvesoftware.com.

                            D. License to Use Valve Game Content in Fan Art.

                            Valve appreciates the community of Subscribers that creates fan art, fan fiction, and
                            audio-visual works that reference Valve games ("Fan Art"). You may incorporate content from
                            Valve games into your Fan Art. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section or in any
                            Subscription Terms, you may use, reproduce, publish, perform, display and distribute Fan Art
                            that incorporates content from Valve games however you wish, but solely on a non-commercial
                            basis.

                            If you incorporate any third-party content in any Fan Art, you must be sure to obtain all
                            necessary rights from the owner of that content.

                            Commercial use of some Valve game content is permitted via features such as Steam Workshop
                            or a Steam Subscription Marketplace. Terms applicable to that use are set forth in Sections
                            3.D. and 6.B. below and in any Subscription Terms provided for those features.

                            Services and any and all copies thereof, are owned by Valve and/or its or its affiliates’
                            licensors. All rights are reserved, except as expressly stated herein. The Content and

                            G. Restrictions on Use of Content and Services

                            You may not use the Content and Services for any purpose other than the permitted access to
                            Steam and your Subscriptions, and to make personal, non-commercial use of your
                            Subscriptions, except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or applicable Subscription
                            Terms. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms
                            or Rules of Use), or under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions, you may not,
                            in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, reverse
                            engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works
                            based on, or remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Content and Services or any
                            software accessed via Steam without the prior consent, in writing, of Valve.

                            You are entitled to use the Content and Services for your own personal use, but you are not
                            entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Content

                            Services to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent
                            expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules
                            of Use); (ii) host or provide matchmaking services for the Content and Services or emulate
                            or redirect the communication protocols used by Valve in any network feature of the Content
                            and Services, through protocol emulation, tunneling, modifying or adding components to the
                            Content and Services, use of a utility program or any other techniques now known or
                            hereafter developed, for any purpose including, but not limited to network play over the
                            Internet, network play utilizing commercial or non-commercial gaming networks or as part of
                            content aggregation networks, websites or services, without the prior written consent of
                            Valve; or (iii) exploit the Content and Services or any of its parts for any commercial
                            purpose, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any
                            Subscription Terms or Rules of Use).

                            3. BILLING, PAYMENT AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTIONS ⏶

                            All charges incurred on Steam, and all purchases made with the Steam Wallet, are payable in
                            advance and final, except as described in Sections 3.I and 7 below.

                            A. Payment Authorization

                            When you provide payment information to Valve or to one of its payment processors, you
                            represent to Valve that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account
                            associated with that payment, and you authorize Valve to charge your credit card or to
                            process your payment with the chosen third-party payment processor for any Subscription,
                            Steam Wallet funds, Hardware or other fees incurred by you. Valve may require you to provide
                            your address or other information in order to meet its obligations under applicable tax law.

                            For Subscriptions purchased based on an agreed usage period, where recurring payments are
                            made in exchange for continued use ("Recurring Payment Subscriptions"), by continuing to use
                            the Recurring Payment Subscription you agree and reaffirm that Valve is authorized to charge
                            your credit card (or your Steam Wallet, if funded), or to process your payment with any
                            other applicable third-party payment processor, for any applicable recurring payment
                            amounts. If you have purchased any Recurring Payment Subscriptions, you agree to notify
                            Valve promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or
                            your billing address, or your PayPal or other payment account number, and you agree to
                            notify Valve promptly if your credit card or PayPal or other payment account expires or is
                            cancelled for any reason.

                            If your use of Steam is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Valve may also charge
                            you for those taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the Rules of
                            Use. The European Union VAT ("VAT") tax amounts collected by Valve reflect VAT due on the
                            value of any Content and Services, Hardware or Subscription.

                            You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your
                            residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at
                            pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose. If you do this, Valve
                            may terminate your access to your Account.

                            B. Responsibility for Charges Associated With Your Account

                            As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable
                            taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family
                            or friends. If you cancel your Account, Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges
                            or costs incurred before cancellation. Any delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled
                            before Valve will allow you to register again.

                            C. Steam Wallet

                            Steam may make available an account balance associated with your Account (the "Steam
                            Wallet"). The Steam Wallet is neither a bank account nor any kind of payment instrument. It
                            functions as a prepaid balance to purchase Content and Services. You may place funds in your
                            Steam Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by Valve, by credit card, prepaid card,
                            promotional code, or any other payment method accepted by Steam. Within any twenty-four (24)
                            hour period, the total amount stored in your Steam Wallet plus the total amount spent out of
                            your Steam Wallet, in the aggregate, may not exceed US$2,000 or its equivalent in your
                            applicable local currency -- attempted deposits into your Steam Wallet that exceed this
                            threshold may not be credited to your Steam Wallet until your activity falls below this
                            threshold. Valve may change or impose different Steam Wallet balance and usage limits from
                            time to time.

                            You will be notified by e-mail of any change to the Steam Wallet balance and usage limits
                            within sixty (60) days before the entry into force of the change. Your continued use of your
                            Steam Account more than thirty (30) days after the entry into force of the changes will
                            constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you don’t agree to the changes, your only
                            remedy is to terminate your Steam Account or to cease use of your Steam Wallet. Valve shall
                            not have any obligation to refund any credits remaining on your Steam Wallet in this case.

                            You may use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Subscriptions, including by making in-game
                            purchases where Steam Wallet transactions are enabled, and Hardware. Subject to Section 3.I,
                            funds added to the Steam Wallet are non-refundable and non-transferable. Steam Wallet funds
                            do not constitute a personal property right, have no value outside Steam and can only be
                            used to purchase Subscriptions and related content via Steam (including but not limited to
                            games and other applications offered through the Steam Store, or in a Steam Subscription
                            Marketplace) and Hardware. Steam Wallet funds have no cash value and are not exchangeable
                            for cash. Steam Wallet funds that are deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the
                            applicable authority.

                            D. Trading and Sales of Subscriptions Between Subscribers

                            Steam may include one or more features or sites that allow Subscribers to trade, sell or
                            purchase certain types of Subscriptions (for example, license rights to virtual items) with,
                            to or from other Subscribers ("Subscription Marketplaces"). An example of a Subscription
                            Marketplace is the Steam Community Market. By using or participating in Subscription
                            Marketplaces, you authorize Valve, on its own behalf or as an agent or licensee of any
                            third-party creator or publisher of the applicable Subscriptions in your Account, to
                            transfer those Subscriptions from your Account in order to give effect to any trade or sale
                            you make.

                            Valve may charge a fee for trades or sales in a Subscription Marketplace. Any fees will be
                            disclosed to you prior to the completion of the trade or sale.

                            If you complete a trade, sale or purchase in a Subscription Marketplace, you acknowledge and
                            agree that you are responsible for taxes, if any, which may be due with respect to your
                            transactions, including sales or use taxes, and for compliance with applicable tax laws.
                            Proceeds from sales you make in a Subscription Marketplace may be considered income to you
                            for income tax purposes. You should consult with a tax specialist to determine your tax
                            liability in connection with your activities in any Subscription Marketplace.

                            You understand and acknowledge that Valve may decide to cease operation of any Subscription
                            Marketplace, change the fees that it charges or change the terms or features of the Steam
                            Subscription Marketplace. Valve shall have no liability to you because of any inability to
                            trade Subscriptions in the Steam Trading Marketplace, including because of discontinuation
                            or changes in the terms, features or eligibility requirements of any Subscription
                            Marketplace.

                            You also understand and acknowledge that Subscriptions traded, sold or purchased in any
                            Subscription Marketplace are license rights, that you have no ownership interest in such
                            Subscriptions, and that Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including
                            transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.

                            E. Retail Purchase

                            Valve may offer or require a Subscription for purchasers of retail packaged product versions
                            or OEM versions of Valve products. The "CD-Key" or "Product Key" accompanying such versions
                            is used to activate your Subscription.

                            F. Steam Authorized Resellers

                            You may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve. The "Product Key"
                            accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription. If you purchase a
                            Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions
                            regarding the Product Key to that reseller.

                            G. Free Subscriptions

                            In some cases, Valve may offer a free Subscription to certain services, software and
                            content. As with all Subscriptions, you are always responsible for any Internet service
                            provider, telephone, and other connection fees that you may incur when using Steam, even
                            when Valve offers a free Subscription.

                            H. Third-Party Sites

                            Steam may provide links to other third-party sites. Some of these sites may charge separate
                            fees, which are not included in and are in addition to any Subscription or other fees that
                            you may pay to Valve. Steam may also provide access to third-party vendors, who provide
                            content, goods and/or services on Steam or the Internet. Any separate charges or obligations
                            you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Valve makes no
                            representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding any third party site. In
                            particular, Valve makes no representation or warranty that any service or subscription
                            offered via third-party vendors will not change or be suspended or terminated.

                            I. Refunds and Right of Withdrawal

                            Without prejudice to any statutory rights you may have, you can request a refund for your
                            purchases on Steam in accordance with the terms of Valve’s Refund Policy
                            http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/.

                            For European Union consumers:

                            EU law provides a statutory right to withdraw from certain contracts for physical
                            merchandise and for the purchase of digital content. You can find more information about the
                            extent of your statutory right to withdraw and the ways you can exercise it on this page:
                            https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8620-QYAL-4516.

                            4. ONLINE CONDUCT, CHEATING AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR ⏶

                            Your online conduct and interaction with other Subscribers should be guided by common sense
                            and basic etiquette. They must notably comply with the Steam Online Conduct Rules, to be
                            found at http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct. Depending on terms of use
                            imposed by third parties who host particular games or other services, additional
                            requirements may also be provided in the Subscription Terms applicable to a particular
                            Subscription.

                            Steam and the Content and Services may include functionality designed to identify software
                            or hardware processes or functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive
                            advantage when playing multiplayer versions of any Content and Services or modifications of
                            Content and Services ("Cheats"). You agree that you will not create Cheats or assist third
                            parties in any way to create or use Cheats. You agree that you will not directly or
                            indirectly disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with the operation of software
                            designed to prevent or report the use of Cheats. You acknowledge and agree that either Valve
                            or any online multiplayer host may refuse to allow you to participate in certain online
                            multiplayer games if you use Cheats in connection with Steam or the Content and Services.
                            Further, you acknowledge and agree that an online multiplayer host may report your use of
                            Cheats to Valve, and Valve may communicate your history of use of Cheats to other online
                            multiplayer hosts. Valve may terminate your Account or a particular Subscription for any
                            conduct or activity that is illegal, constitutes a Cheat, or otherwise negatively affects
                            the enjoyment of Steam by other Subscribers. You acknowledge that Valve is not required to
                            provide you notice before terminating your Subscription(s) and/or Account.

                            You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized
                            third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process.

                            5. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT ⏶

                            In regard to all Subscriptions, Content and Services that are not authored by Valve, Valve
                            does not screen such third-party content available on Steam or through other sources. Valve
                            assumes no responsibility or liability for such third party content. Some third-party
                            application software is capable of being used by businesses for business purposes - however,
                            you may only acquire such software via Steam for private personal use.

                            6. USER GENERATED CONTENT ⏶

                            A. General Provisions

                            Steam provides interfaces and tools for you to be able to generate content and make it
                            available to other users and/or to Valve at your sole discretion. "User Generated Content"
                            means any content you make available to other users through your use of multi-user features
                            of Steam, or to Valve or its affiliates through your use of the Content and Services or
                            otherwise.

                            When you upload your content to Steam to make it available to other users and/or to Valve,
                            you grant Valve and its affiliates the worldwide, non-exclusive right to use, reproduce,
                            modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, transcode, translate, broadcast,
                            and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and publicly perform, your User Generated
                            Content, and derivative works of your User Generated Content, for the purpose of the
                            operation, distribution, incorporation as part of and promotion of the Steam service, Steam
                            games or other Steam offerings, including Subscriptions. This license is granted to Valve as
                            the content is uploaded on Steam for the entire duration of the intellectual property
                            rights. It may be terminated if Valve is in breach of the license and has not cured such
                            breach within fourteen (14) days from receiving notice from you sent to the attention of the
                            Valve Legal Department at the applicable Valve address noted on this Privacy Policy page.
                            The termination of said license does not affect the rights of any sub-licensees pursuant to
                            any sub-license granted by Valve prior to termination of the license. Valve is the sole
                            owner of the derivative works created by Valve from your User Generated Content, and is
                            therefore entitled to grant licenses on these derivative works. If you use Valve cloud
                            storage, you grant us a license to store your information as part of that service. Valve may
                            place limits on the amount of storage you may use.

                            If you provide Valve with any feedback or suggestions about Steam, the Content and Services,
                            or any Valve products, Hardware or services, Valve is free to use the feedback or
                            suggestions however it chooses, without any obligation to account to you.

                            B. Content Uploaded to the Steam Workshop

                            Some games or applications available on Steam ("Workshop-Enabled Apps") allow you to create
                            User Generated Content based on or using the Workshop-Enabled App, and to submit that User
                            Generated Content (a “Workshop Contribution”) to one or more Steam Workshop web pages.
                            Workshop Contributions can be viewed by the Steam community, and for some categories of
                            Workshop Contributions users may be able to interact with, download or purchase the Workshop
                            Contribution. In some cases, Workshop Contributions may be considered for incorporation by
                            Valve or a third-party developer into a game or into a Subscription Marketplace.

                            You understand and agree that Valve is not obligated to use, distribute, or continue to
                            distribute copies of any Workshop Contribution and reserves the right, but not the
                            obligation, to restrict or remove Workshop Contributions for any reason.

                            Specific Workshop-Enabled Apps or Workshop web pages may contain special terms
                            (“App-Specific Terms”) that supplement or change the terms set out in this Section. In
                            particular, where Workshop Contributions are distributed for a fee, App-Specific Terms will
                            address how revenue may be shared. Unless otherwise specified in App-Specific Terms (if
                            any), the following general rules apply to Workshop Contributions.

                            Workshop Contributions are Subscriptions, and therefore you agree that any Subscriber
                            receiving distribution of your Workshop Contribution will have the same rights to use your
                            Workshop Contribution (and will be subject to the same restrictions) as are set out in this
                            Agreement for any other Subscriptions.
                            Notwithstanding the license described in Section 6.A., Valve will only have the right to
                            modify or create derivative works from your Workshop Contribution in the following cases:
                            (a) Valve may make modifications necessary to make your Contribution compatible with Steam
                            and the Workshop functionality or user interface, and (b) Valve or the applicable developer
                            may make modifications to Workshop Contributions that are accepted for in-Application
                            distribution as it deems necessary or desirable to enhance gameplay.
                            You may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the
                            applicable Workshop pages. If you do so, Valve will no longer have the right to use,
                            distribute, transmit, communicate, publicly display or publicly perform the Workshop
                            Contribution, except that (a) Valve may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop
                            Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that
                            allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any
                            Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.
                            Except where otherwise provided in App-Specific Terms, you agree that Valve’s consideration
                            of your Workshop Contribution is your full compensation, and you are not entitled to any
                            other rights or compensation in connection with the rights granted to Valve and to other
                            Subscribers.

                            C. Promotions and Endorsements

                            If you use Steam services (e.g. the Steam Curators’ Lists or the Steam Broadcasting service)
                            to promote or endorse a product, service or event in return for any kind of consideration
                            from a third party (including non-monetary rewards such as free games), you must clearly
                            indicate the source of such consideration to your audience.

                            D. Representations and Warranties

                            You represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated
                            Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A. and B.
                            above or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop
                            page. This includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other
                            proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content. In
                            particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the
                            Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop
                            Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and
                            in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop Contribution on behalf of those
                            other contributors).

                            You furthermore represent and warrant that the User Generated Content, your submission of
                            that Content, and your granting of rights in that Content does not violate any applicable
                            contract, law or regulation.

                            7. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; NO GUARANTEES; LIMITED WARRANTY & AGREEMENT ⏶

                            THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT APPLY TO EU SUBSCRIBERS.

                            FOR AUSTRALIAN SUBSCRIBERS, THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT EXCLUDE, RESTRICT OR MODIFY THE
                            APPLICATION OF ANY GUARANTEE, RIGHT OR REMEDY THAT CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR
                            MODIFIED, INCLUDING THOSE CONFERRED BY THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW (ACL). UNDER THE ACL,
                            GOODS COME WITH GUARANTEES INCLUDING A GUARANTEE THAT GOODS ARE OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY. IF
                            THERE IS A FAILURE OF THIS GUARANTEE, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A REMEDY (WHICH MAY INCLUDE HAVING
                            THE GOODS REPAIRED OR REPLACED OR A REFUND). IF A REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT CANNOT BE PROVIDED
                            OR THERE IS A MAJOR FAILURE, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A REFUND.
                            FOR NEW ZEALAND SUBSCRIBERS, THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT EXCLUDE, RESTRICT OR MODIFY THE
                            APPLICATION OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY THAT CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR MODIFIED
                            INCLUDING THOSE CONFERRED BY THE NEW ZEALAND CONSUMER GUARANTEES ACT 1993. UNDER THIS ACT
                            ARE GUARANTEES WHICH INCLUDE THAT GOODS AND SERVICES ARE OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY. IF THIS
                            GUARANTEE IS NOT MET THERE ARE ENTITLEMENTS TO HAVE THE SOFTWARE REMEDIED (WHICH MAY INCLUDE
                            REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR REFUND). IF A REMEDY CANNOT BE PROVIDED OR THE FAILURE IS OF A
                            SUBSTANTIAL CHARACTER, THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A REFUND.
                            Prior to acquiring a Subscription, you should consult the product information made available
                            on Steam, including Subscription description, minimum technical requirements, and user
                            reviews.

                            A. DISCLAIMERS

                            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VALVE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE
                            PROVIDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM (I) ANY WARRANTY FOR STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, AND THE
                            SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND (II) ANY COMMON LAW DUTIES WITH REGARD TO STEAM, THE CONTENT AND
                            SERVICES, AND THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE AND LACK OF
                            WORKMANLIKE EFFORT. STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND ANY INFORMATION
                            AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, "WITH
                            ALL FAULTS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
                            LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
                            NONINFRINGEMENT. ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312 OF
                            THE UNITED STATES UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND/OR IN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATE STATUTE IS
                            EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. ALSO, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR
                            ENJOYMENT, OR AUTHORITY IN CONNECTION WITH STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE
                            SUBSCRIPTIONS, OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

                            UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

                            B. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

                            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER VALVE, ITS LICENSORS, NOR THEIR
                            AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF VALVE’S SERVICE PROVIDERS, SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR LOSS OR
                            DAMAGE OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR
                            SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE CONTENT AND SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF GOODWILL,
                            WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
                            LOSSES. IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
                            SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
                            CONNECTED WITH STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND ANY INFORMATION
                            AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE CONTENT AND
                            SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTIONS OR ANY INFORMATION, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF VALVE’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’
                            FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH OF VALVE’S WARRANTY AND EVEN
                            IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS AND LIABILITY
                            EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE.

                            BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF
                            LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF
                            VALVE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT

                            C. NO GUARANTEES

                            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER VALVE NOR ITS AFFILIATES
                            GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE OR SECURE OPERATION AND ACCESS TO STEAM, THE
                            CONTENT AND SERVICES, YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S) OR ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE
                            IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

                            D. LIMITED WARRANTY & AGREEMENT

                            CERTAIN HARDWARE PURCHASED FROM VALVE IS SUBJECT TO A LIMITED WARRANTY & AGREEMENT, [OR
                            DEPENDING ON YOUR LOCATION, A STATUTORY WARRANTY] WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HERE.

                            8. AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT ⏶

                            PLEASE NOTE: If you are a consumer with place of residence in Germany, a different version
                            of Section 8 applies to you, which is available here.

                            A. Mutual Amendment

                            This Agreement may at any time be mutually amended by your explicit consent to changes
                            proposed by Valve.

                            B. Unilateral Amendment

                            Furthermore, Valve may amend this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of
                            Use) unilaterally at any time in its sole discretion. In this case, you will be notified by
                            e-mail of any amendment to this Agreement made by Valve at least 30 (30) days before the
                            effective date of the amendment. You can view the Agreement at any time at
                            http://www.steampowered.com/. Your failure to cancel your Account prior to the effective
                            date of the amendment will constitute your acceptance of the amended terms. If you don’t
                            agree to the amendments or to any of the terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to
                            cancel your Account or to cease use of the affected Subscription(s). Valve shall not have
                            any obligation to refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation
                            of your Account or cessation of use of any Subscription, nor shall Valve have any obligation
                            to prorate any fees in such circumstances.

                            9. TERM AND TERMINATION ⏶

                            A. Term

                            The term of this Agreement (the "Term") commences on the date you first indicate your
                            acceptance of these terms, and will continue in effect until otherwise terminated in
                            accordance with this Agreement.

                            B. Termination by You

                            You may cancel your Account at any time. You may cease use of a Subscription at any time or,
                            if you choose, you may request that Valve terminate your access to a Subscription. However,
                            Subscriptions are not transferable, and even if your access to a Subscription for a
                            particular game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be able
                            to be registered to any other account, even if the Subscription was obtained in a retail
                            store. Access to Subscriptions purchased as a part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated
                            individually, termination of access to one game within the bundle will result in termination
                            of access to all games purchased in the pack. Your cancellation of an Account, or your
                            cessation of use of any Subscription or request that access to a Subscription be terminated,
                            will not entitle you to any refund, including of any Subscription fees. Valve reserves the
                            right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of your
                            Account or termination of your access to a particular Subscription. In addition, you are
                            responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or content providers before your
                            cancellation.

                            C. Termination by Valve

                            Valve may cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any time in the event
                            that (a) Valve ceases providing such Subscriptions to similarly situated Subscribers
                            generally, or (b) you breach any terms of this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms
                            or Rules of Use). In the event that your Account or a particular Subscription is terminated
                            or cancelled by Valve for a violation of this Agreement or improper or illegal activity, no
                            refund, including of any Subscription fees or of any unused funds in your Steam Wallet, will
                            be granted.

                            D. Survival of Terms

                            Sections 2.C., 2.D., 2.F., 2.G., 3.A., 3.B., 3.D., 3.H., and 5 - 12 will survive any
                            expiration or termination of this Agreement.

                            10. APPLICABLE LAW/MEDIATION/JURISDICTION/ATTORNEYS’ FEES ⏶

                            For All Customers Outside the European Union:

                            You and Valve agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in
                            the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles
                            and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all claims
                            arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this
                            Agreement; or (iii) your use of Steam, your Account or the Content and Services; except that
                            the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs arbitration as far as your country’s laws permit.
                            Subject to Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) below,
                            you and Valve agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding shall be commenced and
                            maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington,
                            having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive
                            jurisdiction of such courts. In any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
                            your use of Steam, your account, or the Content and Services, the prevailing party will be
                            entitled to attorneys’ fees and expenses (except arbitration -- see Section 11.C.)

                            For EU Customers:

                            In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of
                            the Subscriber Agreement, an amicable solution will be sought before any legal action. You
                            can file your complaint at http://help.steampowered.com. In case of failure, you may, within
                            one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure
                            by filing an online complaint on the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution
                            website: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage.

                            In the event that out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before
                            the competent courts.

                            11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER ⏶

                            This Section 11 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. IN
                            PARTICULAR, IF YOU LIVE IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA) OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, THIS
                            SECTION 11 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.

                            Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at
                            https://support.steampowered.com/. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute
                            remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve
                            it.

                            A. Must Arbitrate All Claims Except IP, Unauthorized Use, Piracy, or Theft

                            YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING
                            ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO:
                            (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US; (ii) THIS AGREEMENT; OR (iii) YOUR USE OF
                            STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT, HARDWARE OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
                            SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION,
                            MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF
                            ANOTHER PARTY.

                            However, this Section 11 does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which
                            you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other
                            misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and
                            (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.

                            This Section 11 does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any
                            federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from
                            us for you.

                            An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or
                            jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited
                            discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited
                            review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of
                            reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE
                            RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.

                            B. Try to Resolve Dispute Informally First

                            You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute
                            before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the
                            other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets
                            forth the relief sought. If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or
                            dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an
                            arbitration. Written notice to Valve must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration
                            Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O. Box 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004.

                            C. Arbitration Rules and Fees

                            The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section 11 as far as your country’s laws
                            permit. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (or the
                            Commercial Arbitration Rules, if the Consumer Arbitration rules are inapplicable) of the
                            American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as modified by this Agreement. Rules are available
                            at http://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.

                            The AAA will administer the arbitration. Outside the U.S., Valve will select a neutral
                            arbitration provider that uses these or similar rules. It may be conducted through the
                            submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another
                            mutually agreed location.

                            If you seek $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to promptly reimburse your filing fee and your
                            share if any of AAA’s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, unless the
                            arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment. Valve agrees
                            not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs unless the arbitrator determines your claims are
                            frivolous or were filed for harassment. If you seek more than $10,000 and the AAA Consumer
                            Arbitration Rules do not apply, the AAA’s arbitration costs, including arbitrator
                            compensation, will be split between you and Valve according to the AAA Commercial
                            Arbitration Rules.

                            D. Individual Binding Arbitration Only

                            YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
                            ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, WHISTLE BLOWER ACTION, OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE
                            ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF
                            ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S
                            INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. You and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration
                            with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement
                            and all other actions or arbitrations.

                            This Agreement does not permit class, collective, or representative arbitration. A court has
                            exclusive authority to rule on any assertion that it does.

                            E. What Happens if Part of Section 11 Is Found Illegal or Unenforceable

                            If any part of Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) is
                            found to be illegal or unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect (with an arbitration
                            award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial
                            illegality or unenforceability would allow class, collective, or representative arbitration,
                            all of Section 11 will be unenforceable and the claim or dispute will be resolved in court.

                            12. MISCELLANEOUS ⏶

                            Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any provision
                            of this Agreement shall be held by an arbitrator, court, or other tribunal of competent
                            jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum
                            extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
                            and effect. Section 11.E. governs if some parts of Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding
                            Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) are held to be illegal or unenforceable. This Agreement,
                            including any Subscription Terms, Rules of Use, the Valve Privacy Policy, and the Valve
                            Hardware Limited Warranty Policy, constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the
                            parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written
                            agreements. You agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any
                            rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement.

                            Valve’s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process and Valve may comply with
                            law enforcement or regulatory requests or requirements notwithstanding any contrary term.

                            You agree to comply with all applicable import/export laws and regulations. You agree not to
                            export the Content and Services or Hardware or allow use of your Account by individuals of
                            any terrorist supporting countries to which encryption exports are at the time of
                            exportation restricted by the U.S. Bureau of Export Administration. You represent and
                            warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
                            such prohibited country.

                            This Agreement was last updated on April 30th, 2019 ("Revision Date"). If you were a
                            Subscriber before the Revision Date, it replaces your existing agreement with Valve or Valve
                            SARL on the day that it becomes effective according to Section 8 above.
